# BosquesNalcahue WebPortal

## Summary
Single Page Application created using Angular 18 as part of a larger demo project for a client. You can find the other components in the system in here:
- .NET MAUI Mobile App => https://github.com/DamianQS7/ForestalCasablancaApp
- ASP.NET Core 8 Web API => https://github.com/DamianQS7/BosquesNalcahueAPI

### Purpose:
This project works in combination with an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API to create a centralized platform for data and files generated by a mobile app. The SPA provides a user-friendly interface for managing, viewing, and analyzing reports while the Web API acts as the backend layer, handling data retrieval and manipulation.

### Key Features:

* User Authentication: Secure login system using JWT tokens to protect user data.
* Report Management:
Display of all generated reports in a list format.
Filtering and searching capabilities for specific reports.
Editing and deleting of existing reports.
* Real-time Updates: Automatic synchronization of PDF files stored in Azure Blob Storage whenever reports are modified or updated.
* Analytics:
Provides computed data based on report information.
Initial implementation includes a product type count metric.
* Session Management: Utilizes Interceptors to maintain user sessions when JWT tokens expire, ensuring a seamless user experience.
* Data Fetching: Leverages an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API for efficient and secure data retrieval from the backend.
